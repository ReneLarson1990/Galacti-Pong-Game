## Deployment

The web game is deployed at https://renelarson1990.github.io/Galacti-Pong-Game/
The GitHub Repo is located here at https://github.com/ReneLarson1990/Galacti-Pong-Game.git


## Project Description

My plan for this game is to make 2 of my favorite games as a kid combined but also add some funny new 3d elements and make the game a bit harder to beat.
my inspiration for this game was based on Namco's Galaga made in 1981 and Namco Atari's Pong made in 1972 which is basically the the great grand daddy of all video games. i made this game with the intention of making you feel like you were playing in a arcade game in the late 1980's to 1990's, i wanted the game to give off that retro style vibe with a bit of modernized adaptation. 


## Game Logic
This Game is based in a not so distant Galaxy. the goal of the game is to prevent the Galactic Orb from getting past you and destroying anymore planets. the enemy ship is a Galactic destroyer determined to destroy the galaxy as you know it. you are a STAX fighter from the MADSTAX fleet. your directive is to defend the galaxy at all cost. This Fight is endless and the more you score the more of the galaxy you save. send this destroyer back to its mother ship. Teach these Galactic Leeches a Lesson but stay steadfast the destroyer has a minion determined to undermine your success.
  - What are the choices available to the player? 
  answer: avoid the minion at all cost he is a pest. use up and down keys to pass the orb back at your enemy. use the space bar to pause and play background music.
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
  answer: you either save the planet or you fail the universe bom bom booooom.

the basic logic is that if the orb passes by either opponents ship a point is granted to the opposing player. if the destroyers minion attacks the orb or the player a point is granted to the destroyer.

## Deliverables
what i want to deliver was a challenging yet fun experience that brings back some of those good ol childhood arcade memories and nostalgia.

### MVP Criteria

- My Game needs to work properly with the AI i made to play against.
- the score needs to be added to the side of the player or AI that won the round.
- This Game needs to be Visually appealing and The score and hit sound effects need to work.
- the minion needs to be randomly annoying as can be without making players quit.


### Post-MVP Plans

- I would like to add Space junk to the game that if it collides with the ball or player ship it awards a point to the enemy AI.
- I want to add more levels and obstacles as i learn more in coding.
- I do struggle with java script at the current moment so i was planning on adding a menu screen and a persistent high score board. i also wanted to add and actual AI from an API and use it to make the movement of the AI less jittery.

- i used ChatGpt to help me with understanding of some of the code so that i could modify it to work the way i wanted it to with the game i was building. i also used youtube for a multitude of videos i do not remember all of the just for understanding of certain functions and to understand java script better. www.w3schools.com also had a good part of helping me understand some of the code i was writing.

- The Art Work was made by MADSTAX aka Me (Rene A. Larson)

AI ship 
playership 
the minion 
ect. 
i used 3d paint to build some basic components.
