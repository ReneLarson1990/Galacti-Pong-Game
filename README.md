- This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class.
- This game must run in a web browser.

## Game Requirements

- The game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or for 1 player (PvE).
  - The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI. (In this case, think of "AI" as a logical pattern.)
  - For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
- The game should be winnable, or it should keep score (or track player progress in a meaningful way).
  - When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts.
  - If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be written in separate files.
- Effort must be spent on styling and appearance.
- The HTML code should use sematic tags.
- The GitHub repository for your game should have a README.md that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality.

# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

_Before you start programming your project_... plan it!

Complete the planning sections below and include them in the README.md of your project repository. Once you're done, reach out to your instructional staff -- they'll examine your plan, help you scope it appropriately for the tools available to you and think ahead toward technical solutions, and point out any areas that could use any more thought. _Use the template below!_

--------

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <YOUR DEPLOYED GITHUB.IO URL GOES HERE>.


## Project Description

_(Replace this text with a brief description of your game and what inspired you to make it.)_


## Game Logic

```
XXX IMPORTANT! Replace all of this text with your own writing as you do these tasks/answer these questions THEN DELETE THIS LINE XXX

The writing should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
  - What are the choices available to the player?
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
```

## Deliverables

>Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term **[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP)** -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.
>
>*Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as **Post-MVP Ideas**. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!*
>
> For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.


### MVP Criteria

- My Game needs to work properly with the AI i made to play against.
- the score needs to be added to the side of the player or AI that won the round.
- This Game needs to be Visually appealing and The score and hit sound effects need to work.


### Post-MVP Plans

- I would like to add Space junk to the game that if it collides 
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)


XXX IMPORTANT! USE THIS SPACE FOR THE SCHEDULE WE END UP MAKING IN CLASS AND ADD ANY PERSONAL INFO AS NEEDED. THE README IS NOT JUST A PLACE TO TELL OTHERS ABOUT THE CODE IN YOUR APP, BUT ALSO IT CAN BE A PART OF THE WAY YOU PLAN AND KEEP TRACK OF YOUR PROGRESS MAKING YOUR APP. BUT MAKE SURE TO DELETE ALL OF TEXT BELOW THIS LINE BEFORE YOU SUBMIT THE PROJECT FINALLY XXX
